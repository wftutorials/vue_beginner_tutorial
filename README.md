# The Vue.js Blackboard Tutorial

This is a sample tutorial used to experiment with the features of Vue.js. I created a blackboard that allows users to enter text in a text input and have that text blow up in scale so others can see it easily.

You can learn more about vue.js here - https://vuejs.org/

The walk-through for this application can be found here -  https://wftutorials.wordpress.com/2019/01/11/vue-tutorial/
